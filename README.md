## Intructions for Running Satellite Image Road Segmentation Example
1. Run through semantic_segmentation.ipynb. The current default is unet. If want to get the result for fpn, leave only ```model_path = './best_model_full.pth'``` uncommented.  
2. Run through per_pixel_overlap.ipynb. The current default is unet. If want to get result for fpn, uncomment ``` mask_dir = '../predictions_fpn/'```

## Data Preprocessing
The directory containing the data to process is used as an argument when calling the program. Here is an example command to apply preprocessing to the `train` images in the `roads` directory.

```python data_preprocessing.py data/roads/train/```

Install requirements: 
```pip3 install requirements.txt```
